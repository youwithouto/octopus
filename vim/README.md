#### Useful plugins

###### Split layout

Split vertically: `:sp <filename>`
Split horizontally: `:vs <filename>`

###### Buffers

While VIM can do tabs, many users prefer buffers and splits. You can think of a buffer as a recently opened file. VIM provides easy access to recent buffers.

Switch to an open buffer: `:b <buffer name or number>`
